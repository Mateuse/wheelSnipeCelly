    The Edmonton Oilers have had a rocky start to the season, plagued by sluggish play, misfired passes, and an
    inability to sustain a full 60-minute effort. In times like these, a fresh approach can be a game-changer. That's
    precisely what coach Jay Woodcroft aims for in an upcoming offensive zone faceoff. By deploying his team in a
    non-traditional setup at the dot, he orchestrates a lightning-quick goal. Let's dive into the clip below to see how
    it unfolds.
</p>

<p>
    The most striking aspect of this setup is Evander Kane, the left winger, positioned directly behind Leon Draisaitl
    at the faceoff dot. This unconventional arrangement is central to the play's success. Aside from Kane, Evan Bouchard
    is positioned very far on the opposite side of the zone, which will be important later on in the play.
</p>

<p>
    Of course, the success of this play hinges on winning the faceoff, a task that falls to Draisaitl. Fortunately for
    the Oilers, he's one of the best in the business, currently ranking fifth in the NHL with a faceoff win percentage
    of 57.2%.
</p>

<p>
    As expected, Draisaitl delivers on his faceoff prowess. As illustrated in the following image, he aims to direct the
    puck straight to Kane, who is strategically positioned behind him.

<p>
    With the puck going directly to Kane, let's look at another key aspect of the play and that is Edmonton's right
    winger, Mattias Janmark.
</p>

<p>
    At the faceoff dot, Janmark is positioned adjacent to three Minnesota Wild players. As the referee prepares to
    drop the puck, Janmark starts to cut toward the center of the faceoff circle. This move effectively blocks Pat
    Maroon of the Wild from immediately pressuring Kane, affording Kane valuable seconds to advance the play.

<p>
    As illustrated in the subsequent image, Janmark's pick successfully delays Maroon from getting to Kane. Furthermore,
    it hinders Marcus Johansson from applying additional pressure to the passing lane, prompting him to circle back
    toward the opposite faceoff dot.
</p>

<p>
    Thanks to the extra time Janmark bought him, Kane is able to skillfully control the pass on his backhand, transition
    it to his forehand, and then feed it to Evan Bouchard. As seen in the image below, Maroon's stick intrudes into
    Kane's space just moments after the puck is passed. Without Janmark's timely interference, Maroon would likely have
    been able to disrupt the play.

<p>
    Upon receiving the pass, Evan Bouchard finds himself wide open, thanks to his initial positioning on the far side of
    the zone. It's worth noting that Bouchard possesses a formidable slap shot, capable of reaching speeds of 90 mph
    in-game and a recorded 103 mph at an AHL skills competition. Given the chance, he won't hesitate to unleash it.
</p>

<p>
    After setting the pick on Maroon, Janmark swiftly moves to position himself in front of the net, obstructing goalie
    Filip Gustavsson's line of sight. This screening tactic proves crucial for Bouchard's incoming shot. As evidenced in
    the clip, we see Gustavsson straining to catch a glimpse of the puck by tilting his head over Janmark's shoulder,
    indicating the effectiveness of the screen.
</p>

<p>
    From Gustavsson's angle, it becomes clear just how effective the screening is. Not only is Janmark blocking his
    direct line of sight in front of the net, but his own teammate, Johansson, is also setting a high screen. This
    double-layered obstruction leaves Gustavsson virtually blind to Bouchard's incoming shot. Resulting in the Oilers
    quick goal.

<p>
    In a nutshell, the Oilers' cleverly designed offensive zone faceoff play is a testament to the power of strategic
    thinking in hockey. Each player had a crucial role, from Draisaitl's faceoff win to Kane's pass and Bouchard's
    killer slap shot. Janmark's disruptions and screening effectively sealed the deal, making it nearly impossible for
    goalie Gustavsson to react in time. This play showcases how ingenuity and teamwork can shift momentum, even in a
    challenging season.
</p>

<p>
    Unfortunetly for the oilers, this quick goal was not enough to propel them towards a vicotry. They're season woes
    continue as they end up losing 7-4 in another disapointing overall performance.
