    On October 27th, 2022 hockey fans were able to witness one of the season's finest plays, a masterclass in teamwork.
    The San Jose Sharks and the Toronto Maple Leafs. Occuring during the end of the second period with the Sharks having
    a 3 - 1 lead, this play showcases the sort of magic that can only be conjured when every player is on the same page.

    The play unfolds as the Sharks enter the Leafs' zone where the puck is dropped off to Timo Meier. What's crucial
    here is Matthews, who jumps off the bench and immediately tracks down the puck. His intense pressure on Meier forces
    the rushed, ill-advised decision of throwing a no-look pass towards the center of the zone. This error proves
    costly, as Marner, who's perfectly positioned for center zone coverage, intercepts the puck and exits the zone.

    Marner then accelerates into the Sharks zone and and initiates a beautiful passing sequence. First he drops the puck
    off to Matthews, who quickly relays it to Kerfoot. Kerfoot then advances the puck to the Rielly, who is driving the
    left side of the net. Without missing a beat, Rielly executes a one-touch pass back to Marner on the opposite side of the
    net. Seizing the opportunity, the un-guarded Marner lifts the puck just above the Sharks' goaltender's left pad,
    finishing off the beautiful sequence.
