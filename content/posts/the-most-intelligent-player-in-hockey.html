    Sydney Crosby's intelligence on the ice is truly something to behold. With an uncanny ability to anticipate plays,
    he
    often decides where the puck should go even before it reaches him. This foresight has kept him at the the top of NHL
    even as he enters his 19th season. Below is just a few short clips of Crosby's hockey IQ in action.

<p>
    In the clip above, Crosby executes remarkable pass after remarkable pass, almost as if he has eyes in the back of
    the head. Such an ability is rare even at the highest level of the game, and possessing this skill can drastically
    elevate a player's game. So what's the secret behind this unparalleled vision, let's take a look.
</p>

<p>
    What sets Crosby apart is his remarkable ability to scan the ice just before receiving the pass. With this brief
    glance, he quickly assesses the positioning and movement of players, allowing him to instantaneously determine the
    most optimal play. The image below perfectly illustrates this technique.

<p>
    In the image above, Crosby is positioned in front of the net, anticipating a pass. But instead of passively waiting
    like
    many players would, he instinctively glances to his right. This quick look gives him the information he needs to
    make his next play. Seeing that a
    teammate is positioned on the opposite side of the net, Crosby masterfully receives the
    pass and swiftly redirects it across the crease, setting up an easy tap in goal.

    Thanks to that swift look, Crosby can execute the pass without needing to visually confirm his teammate's
    position. While most players might have opted for a forehand pass, which would have caused them to pass through a
    defender increasing the risk of an interception, Crosby's prior knowledge allows him to choose his backhand.
    This choice effectively shields the puck with his body, keeping it out of the defender's reach. With the puck fully
    protected, Crosby smoothly slides it across the crease, setting up the goal.

<p>
    This look is signature Crosby and has allowed him to make several insane passes over the years. Below is a few more
    examples of the quick glances his makes to gather the information he needs to make the perfect play.

<p>
    This swift glance not only allows him to adjust to his opponents' positions but also to deceive them, executing
    passes that are nearly impossible to intercept. It's one of the primary reasons Crosby has been able to consistently
    score above a point per game throughout his career. A feat that's all the more impressive considering he played a
    significant portion of his career during periods known for lower scoring rates.
