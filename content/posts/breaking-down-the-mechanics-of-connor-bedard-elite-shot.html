    Regarded as the most exciting prospect since McDavid, Connor Bedard is set to make his NHL debut, with experts
    already anointing him as the league's next superstar. As the first player ever to receive exceptional status in the
    WHL, Bedard has accumulated an impressive array of accolades, including WHL Player of the Year and CHL Player of the
    Year. He also holds the record as Canada's all-time points leader at the World Juniors. Among the many attributes
    that make Bedard an extraordinary talent, his most discussed skill is his otherworldly shot—a skill refined through
    countless hours of practice and already considered one of the best in the NHL. Below is a video showcasing just a
    glimpse of his incredible shooting ability.

<p>
    If you weren't alreday convinced of Bedard's shooting ability, the above video should have left you speechless. It's
    a shot that most players dream of having, a perfectly executed Toe Drag Release. So, what exactly goes into crafting
    such a masterful shot? Let's dive in and take a closer look.
</p>

<p>
    In the video, we get an excellent perspective on the technique Bedard employs to release his shot. From set up all
    the way to release. It's important to note that Bedard is a right-handed shooter, meaning his top hand is his left
    and his bottom hand is his right. For left-handed shooters, the same principles would apply but with opposite hand
    placements.
</p>

<p>
    Next, let's zero in on Bedard's initial positioning as he prepares to fire off his shot. One key element to focus
    on is the placement of his top hand relative to his body. This seemingly small detail plays a significant role in
    the power and accuracy of his shot.

<p>
    As highlighted in the picture above, you'll notice Bedard's top hand is positioned in front of his lower opposite
    thigh, almost crossing the width of his body. This contrasts with the conventional approach of keeping the top hand
    on the
    near the same-side hip. So, what benefits does this unique hand placement offer? For starters, it allows Bedard to
    significantly alter the angle of his shot's release. Beginning with the top hand at a greater distance from the body
    results in the puck having a larger travel distance, thereby creating multiple potential release points. This
    versatility gives
    Bedard the upper hand in tailoring his shot angle according to the current game scenario. Moreover, it adds
    another layer of unpredictability, providing him the option to fake a shot and maneuver around defenders who has
    committed
    to blocking it.
</p>

<p>
    The next crucial element contributing to Bedard's exceptional shot is the positioning of his top hand's wrist during
    the wind-up.
</p>

<p>
    The first thing to understand is that generating power in a wrist shot requires flexing the stick. This flex is
    achieved by pushing outwards with the top hand while applying pressure to the shaft of the stick with the bottom
    hand. This dual action flexes the stick with generates extra power for the shot. What sets Bedard apart is the angle
    of his wrist on his top
    hand. As he extends his top arm, his wrist angles inwards towards his body, creating an
    almost 90-degree angle with his forearm, as seen in the above image. This nuanced adjustment enables him to add
    extra flex to his stick, thereby
    firing off a more powerful shot with just a minor tweak.
</p>

<p>
    Another remarkable feature of Bedard's shot is his versatility, he can shoot effectively in almost any situation.
    This adaptability has led many to believe that he is incapable of taking a 'bad' shot, such is the potency of his
    offense.

<p>
    The image above serves as a striking example of exactly that. What can be seen here is his lateral shooting
    stance. Unlike most players who position the puck slightly ahead of their bodies—making it vulnerable to
    defenders—Bedard keeps the puck laterally aligned with his body. As seen in the picture, this places the puck just
    out of the defender's reach, minimizing the risk of a poke check. In essence, this lateral positioning enables
    Bedard to take shots that most players wouldn't be able to successfully execute.
</p>

<p>
    Another intriguing aspect of Bedard's shooting style is his choice of stick length. While most forwards opt for a
    stick that reaches up to their chin when on skates—facilitating quicker shot releases and better puck control—Bedard
    deviates from the norm. He uses a stick that extends to around his nose while on skates. This added length enhances
    the toe-drag component of his shot, thereby creating an even wider range of release points.
</p>

<p>
    Furthermore, Bedard opts for a 70-flex stick, a surprisingly flexible choice for someone weighing 185 pounds. To put
    it into perspective, most NHL forwards gravitate towards sticks with a mid-80s flex. The lower flex of Bedard's
    stick, when combined with its longer shaft, enhances the whip of his shot dramatically. This synergy allows him to
    deliver powerful shots that find their way into the net with remarkable speed and precision.
</p>

<p>
    Bedard's shot is something truely exceptional, a product of both natural talent but also relentless practice.
    Watching it in action over the next years is truely going to be a treat to behold.
